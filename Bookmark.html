        <p style="background-color: cadetblue;">AVUL PAKIR JAINULABDEEN ABDUL KALAM has come to personally
            represent to many of his countrymen the best aspects of Indian life. Born in
            1931, the son of a little educated boatowner in Rameswaram, Tamilnadu, he had
            an unparalleled career as a defence scientist, culminating in the highest civilian
            award of India, the Bharat Ratna.The family business had involved trading groceries between the mainland and the island and to and from Sri Lanka, as well as ferrying pilgrims between the mainland and Pamban. With the opening of the Pamban Bridge to the mainland in 1914, however, the businesses failed and the family fortune and properties were lost by the 1920s, apart from the ancestral home. The family was poverty-stricken by the time Kalam was born. As a young boy he had to sell newspapers to add to the family's meager income.</p>

        <p style="background-color: darksalmon;">As chief of the countrys defence research and development programme, Kalam
            demonstrated the great potential for dynamism and innovation that existed in
            seemingly moribund research establishments. This is the story of Kalams rise
            from obscurity and his personal and professional struggles, as well as the
            story of Agni, Prithvi, Akash, Trishul and Nag - missiles that have become
            household names in India and that have raised the nation to the level of a
            missile power of international recokoning.South Asian leaders expressed condolences and lauded the late statesman. The Bhutanese government ordered the country's flags to fly at half-staff to mourn Kalam's death and lit 1000 butter lamps in homage. Bhutanese Prime Minister Tshering Tobgay expressed deep sadness, saying Kalam "was a leader greatly admired by all people, especially the youth of India who have referred to him as the people's President".</p>

        <p style="background-color: coral;">At the same time as he has helped create Indias awesome weaponry, Kalam
            has maintained the ascetic rigour of his personal life, working 18 hours a day
            and practicing the veena. With characteristic modesty, Kalam ascribes the
            greatness of his achievement to the influence of his teachers and mentors. He
            describes the struggles of his boyhood and youth, bringing alive everyday life
            in a small town in South India and the inspirational role of educators. He describes
            the role of visionary Indian scientists, such as Dr Vikram Sarabhai, and of the
            creation of a coordinated network of research institutions. This is also the saga
            of independent Indias struggle for technological self sufficiency and defensive
            autonomy  a story as much about politics, domestic and international, as it is
            about science.United States President Barack Obama extended "deepest condolences to the people of India on the passing of former Indian President Dr. APJ Abdul Kalam", and highlighted his achievements as a scientist and as a statesman, notably his role in strengthening US–India relations and increasing space co-operation between the two nations. "Suitably named 'the People's President', Dr. Kalam's humility and dedication to public service served as an inspiration to millions of Indians and admirers around the world."[113] Russian President Vladimir Putin expressed sincere condolences and conveyed his sympathy and support "to the near and dear ones of the deceased leader, to the government, and entire people of India". He remarked on Kalam's outstanding "personal contribution to the social, economic, scientific, and technical progress of India and in ensuring its national security," adding that Kalam would be remembered as a "consistent exponent of closer friendly relations between our nations, who has done a lot for cementing mutually beneficial Russian–Indian cooperation.</p>

            Defence Research and Development Laboratory (DRDL), Hyderabad. He is
            currently Director, Cardiovascular Technology Institute, Hyderabad, where he
            is pursuing Dr Kalams vision of developing cost-effective medical devices
            using indigenous defence technology.Kathleen Wynne, the Premier of Ontario, which Kalam had visited on numerous occasions, expressed "deepest condolences ... as a respected scientist, he played a critical role in the development of the Indian space programme. As a committed educator, he inspired millions of young people to achieve their very best. And as a devoted leader, he gained support both at home and abroad, becoming known as 'the people's President'. I join our Indo–Canadian families, friends, and neighbours in mourning the passing of this respected leader.</p>
